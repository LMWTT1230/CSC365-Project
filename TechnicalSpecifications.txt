Technical Specifications

Requirements:

User stories/User requirements. Describe the flows that users will go through and how they will interact with the application.
Documentation on what endpoints you will create. This should be at the same level of detail as what I provided in Assignment 1.
Detailed descriptions of edge cases and transaction flows. For example, if the app has a credit card checkout, describe what happens 
if the credit card transaction fails, what happens if the user tries to cancel mid-way through, etc.

Your initial version of your application should have at least 5 endpoints, and at least one endpoint must be adding/updating data.
