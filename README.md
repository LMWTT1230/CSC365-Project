CSC 365: Project Proposal
Team Members: Will Kang & Julian Murillo

We hope to use a collection of UFC fight data obtained from Kaggle to create a new backend API as our group project this quarter. The UFC (ultimate fighting championship) is the premier mixed marshal arts competition in the world that hosts events throughout the year on a near weekly basis. We can perform reading operations by accessing current fighter and event data and using SQL commands to extract the information we desire. We are also aiming to update our database (write to it) by updating it with new fight event entries as well as updated fighter statistics.
